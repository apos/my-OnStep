## My private OnStep source code repo

* Branch 3.16 (used and proven to work with MKS GEN L v1.0, TMC 5160 and 2130 (Waterott)
* Branch 4.24 (used and proben to work with MKS GEN L v 2.0, TMC 5160 (Bigtreetek V 1.2)

## Hardware
### MKS GEN L V 2.0
The best is: plug the Bigtreetech TMC5160 in without any cables. Finding the correct values for current and goto (!) microsteps can be a bit tricky.

### Stepper
* Nema 17 Bipolar 0.9deg 36Ncm (51oz.in) 0.9A 5.4V 42x42x40mm 4 Wires 
* 17HM15-0904S
* ca 30,- â‚¬

### OnStep App (Handy)

Android and iPhone
1. Set location once
2. Set Time and date
3. start tracking (unpark only, if parked previously)

iPhone App crashes when using GoTo.

### SkySafari

## OnStep Configuration (Config.h)
#### Serial 
    #define SERIAL_C_BAUD_DEFAULT  9600  //  must be set to 9600 if TX2/RX2 are used (which should you do)


#### Motors
    #define TRACK_BACKLASH_RATE    10    //  good experences with both MKS V1 and v2

    #define SLEW_RATE_BASE_DESIRED        2.5   // giv es me a good mix between speed and robustness
    #define SLEW_RATE_MEMORY              OFF
    #define SLEW_ACCELERATION_DIST        7.0   // more than default - not necessary to put the mount into stress
    #define SLEW_RAPID_STOP_DIST          4.0   // more than default - don't like to rapid stops
    
    #define PIER_SIDE_SYNC_CHANGE_SIDES   ON    // I am still testing
    #define PIER_SIDE_PREFERRED_DEFAULT  BEST
